README - Hase Adoption & Care Game

Welcome to the Hase Adoption & Care Game, a fun little project where you can adopt and take care of your very own bunnies! üêá This project is still a work in progress, so there may be additional features or improvements in the future.
Features:

    Adopt a Bunny: Name and adopt a bunny to start your adventure.

    Pet a Bunny: Choose one of your adopted bunnies to pet and earn money.

    Fill Your Fridge: Purchase food for your bunnies to keep them happy and healthy.

    Feed Your Bunny: Feed your bunnies with items from your fridge.

How to Play:

    Adopt a Bunny:

        You can adopt a bunny by entering its name. If you've already adopted a bunny with that name, you will be notified that it already exists.

        Command: add_hase()

    Pet a Bunny:

        You can pet any bunny you have adopted. Petting a bunny earns you 50 Euros.

        Command: pet_hase()

    Fill Your Fridge:

        You can buy food for your bunnies, including carrots, salad, or bread, but only if you have enough money. You can check your current balance at any time.

        Command: fill_k√ºhlschrank()

    Feed Your Bunny:

        You can choose which bunny to feed and give them food from your fridge. Once you feed your bunny, the food item will be removed from your fridge.

        Command: feed_hase()

Current Features (Work in Progress):

    Bunny Adoption: You can adopt multiple bunnies.

    In-game Money: Money is earned by petting bunnies and spent on food for them.

Planned Features:

    More food options and interactions.

    A better inventory system.

    Additional bunny care tasks like playing, cleaning, and more.

Known Bugs/Limitations:

    Money and food items aren't persistent across different game sessions.

    The game is still under development, so some features may be incomplete.
